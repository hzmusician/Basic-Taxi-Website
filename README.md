I think it can help people find a taxi quickly and safely.
Since the taxi driver asked me for a simple, functional, plain site, I built a site that gave only what was expected without adding anything unnecessary.

I hope it has been a useful project for people living in Sivas.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The website is currently open for active use.
